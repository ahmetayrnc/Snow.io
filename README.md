# Snow.io
Snow.io a 3D io game where you eat things.
Roll around in the snow and eat things that are smaller than you. You'll get bigger overtime as you roll. Eat things to grow even more.

##### How to play
In Snow.io the main goal is to get bigger as possible in 2 minutes. You control the snowball with your finger with an invisible joystick.
- After the timer ends the player with the highest score will win.
- You collect points by eating things and other snowballs.

## Notes
- Snow.io is a game made using the Unity Game Engine.
- It uses shader graphs to create the snow effect and the transparency effect when the snowball goes behind objects.
- It uses tweening to make everything smoother.
